    <td>The purpose of this event was to help students at the Kurunegala regional campus of the NIBM (National Institute of Business Management, Sri Lanka) understand the basics of Microsoft 365 and related Office 365 technologies and get started with their student accounts. Even before attending the session, most of the participants had some experience with Microsoft Office. So, the session began by providing an overview of how the Microsoft 365 platform and its services are built on the Microsoft Office platform. Then they were given instructions on how to begin the process of setting up their university-issued Microsoft 365 account. Students were given a hands-on demonstration of how to use Microsoft 365 services and apps, including examples of collaborating with peers on academic activities. At the end, they also got a quick overview of how they can work with other tech communities and prepare themselves with self-taught learning strategies and relevant certificates, badges, and modules.</td>
